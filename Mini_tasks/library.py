# Practice
# Create some books
book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
book2 = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")
book3 = Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald")

# Create a library
library = Library()

# Add books to the library
library.add_book(book1)
library.add_book(book2)
library.add_book(book3)

# Display books
library.display_books()
