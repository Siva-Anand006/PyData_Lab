'''
The exercise template includes a class named ExamSubmission, which models an examinee's submission in an exam. 
The ExamSubmission class has the following attributes:

examinee (str): The name of the examinee.
points (int): The score obtained by the examinee.
Your task is to write a function named passed(submissions: list, lowest_passing: int), which takes two arguments:

submissions: A list of ExamSubmission objects.
lowest_passing: An integer representing the lowest passing grade.
The function should return a new list containing only the ExamSubmission objects from the original 
list that meet or exceed the lowest_passing grade. You are not allowed to modify the original list 
of submissions or the ExamSubmission class definition.
